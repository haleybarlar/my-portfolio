      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Hi. My name is Haley Barlar.</p>
      <p>
        I am a frontend engineer with a focus on accessibilty, UX, and design
        systems. I currently live in Atlanta, Georgia working as a software
        engineer at Vertis. My responsibilities vary, but I mostly handle
        building out reusable components, working end to end to build out new
        features, and QA testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work primarily with Typescript and React, and I'm a big fan of css. I
        have experience using both Styled Components and Tailwind, and while I
        have opinions on both, I believe that they're both tools to get to the
        same outcome. Deciding on whether or not to focus on accessibility is
        the hill I choose to die on, and I always am in favor of doing what is
        best for the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working, I'm probably trail running, crying over cute dogs,
        or listening to Andrew Huberman talk about the importance of sunlight.
      </p>
    </>
