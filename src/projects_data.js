    description: "This was a response to my brain being filled with clutter. I was constantly thinking about what I needed to do, ideas for apps, places I wanted to go, it was an endless cycle of ideas.  Eventually I realized that if I could just get the clutter out, I'd be able to be more productive and use that energy for a greater purpose.  So I created Mindful Todo: the place to put your thoughts.  Somewhere you could keep track of everything you were thinking and lock it away until you were ready to see it again.  Completed tasks and lists were recorded to create a sense of responsibilty and reward.",

    description: "As a former yoga teacher, one of the biggest challenges I faced was creating enough creative and unique sequences to keep my students engaged and safe.  Yoga Cycle is a response to this.  It is an app for teachers and students to create sequences in little time. Sequences are added to a class card which can then be displayed and used during a class to guide or be guided.",

    description: "A master copy is one of the greatest ways to learn a new skill.  It is done by selecting something you admire and attempting to recreate it in order to better understand the process and further appreciate the skill that went into the creation.  When learning CSS, I chose to do a master copy of Daily Harvest's website in order to achieve this.  Everything was created using pure CSS and later translating that into SASS.",

While exploring into the traditional technique of beading, I wanted to use beading as a sort of free-form organic flow.  Drawing inspiration for undulations in nature, I allowed the beads to spark inspiration and let my hand move on their own accord.",
